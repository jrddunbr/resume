# resume

This is the source code for my resume.

To build my resume, run the following command on a NixOS system:

```
nix-shell default.nix
```

This will download all of the NixOS LaTeX packages (at least 10-20 minutes first run), and then build my resume and my CV.

You may need to rename them to resume.tex and cv.tex.
